# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch

#  push:
#    branches: [ master ]
#  pull_request:
#    branches: [ master ]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 11-15 * * *"  # 20:00 - 24:00 JST

    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    - name: Update 
      run: |
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
